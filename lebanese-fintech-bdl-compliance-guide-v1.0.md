# 1. Executive Summary

This guide provides Lebanese FinTech companies with a comprehensive
framework for understanding and implementing Banque Du Liban (BDL)
regulatory compliance requirements. It includes practical mapping
between BDL regulations and international standards (ISO 27001:2022, ISO
27017, PCI DSS, Basel III) to help organizations achieve regulatory
compliance while working with hosting providers.

### 1.2 🚨 Key Regulatory Reality

While Banque Du Liban (BDL) has not issued a standalone circular
explicitly prohibiting all forms of cloud computing, its stringent data
sovereignty requirements, coupled with the provisions of the Banking
Secrecy Law and BDL's supervisory oversight, effectively mandate that
all sensitive financial data for regulated activities must remain within
Lebanese jurisdiction. This practical reality leads to an effective
prohibition of international cloud-based solutions (like AWS, Azure,
GCP) for production data and core regulated activities.

### 1.3 ⚠️ Most Critical BDL Requirements & Strict Prohibitions

#### 1.3.1 **EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITED** ❌

-   **Hosting of production data subject to Banking Secrecy Law on
    international public clouds (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).** This is due
    to BDL's strict data sovereignty, supervisory access, and banking
    secrecy requirements, making such hosting non-viable without
    explicit **BDL approval** under a future framework.
-   **Cross‑border export of banking‑secrecy‑protected data without an
    explicit legal basis and supervisory approval (mere client consent
    is not sufficient)**
-   **Outsourcing of compliance monitoring** to third parties. Circular
    128 does not, by itself, prohibit outsourcing technology,
    infrastructure, hosting, managed security operations, or other
    IT/operational services, provided the institution maintains an
    in‑house, independent Compliance Department and retains overall
    accountability.
-   **Uncontrolled remote access from outside Lebanon to production
    systems.** Any such access must be considered exceptional, justified
    by a formal risk assessment, and implemented with robust
    compensating controls (e.g., Privileged Access Management, session
    recording, multi-factor authentication, geo-fencing, and time-bound
    approvals), subject to BDL/BCC review.
-   **Data processing outside Lebanese territory**
-   **Backup replication** to foreign data centers

#### 1.3.2 **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS** ✅

-   **Prior BDL approval** for all digital banking applications
-   **Prompt incident reporting to BDL for critical security incidents
    (generally interpreted as within 24 hours of confirmation).** Note
    that the Special Investigation Commission (SIC) must also be
    notified in cases involving suspicious financial transactions or
    money laundering.
-   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Mandatory for all interactive
    user access to critical systems, all administrative/privileged
    accounts, and all remote access sessions. A risk-based approach may
    be documented for low-risk, internal-only systems.
-   **Board-approved business continuity plans** submitted to BCC
-   **Lebanese jurisdiction** for all data and infrastructure
-   **Strong encryption** for all data in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2+) and
    at rest (e.g., AES-256)

## 2 BDL Regulatory Framework Overview

### 2.1 Primary BDL Regulations for FinTech

#### 2.1.1 BDL Basic Circular 69/2000 - Electronic Banking Operations

-   **Requirement:** Prior BDL approval for all digital banking
    applications
-   **Impact:** Must demonstrate compliance before launching services
-   **Documentation:** Technology infrastructure assessment required

#### 2.1.2 BDL Basic Circular 144/2017 - Cybersecurity Measures

-   **Requirements:**
    -   Two-factor authentication mandatory
    -   Strong encryption in transit (TLS 1.2/1.3) and encryption at
        rest (e.g., AES‑256). Where feasible, apply application‑layer
        encryption for the most sensitive data.
    -   24-hour incident reporting to BDL
    -   Regular security assessments and penetration testing

#### 2.1.3 BDL Basic Circular 141/2017 - Recovery Plans

-   **Requirements:**
    -   Board-approved business continuity plans
    -   Plans submitted to Banking Control Commission (BCC)
    -   Regular testing and updates
    -   Alternative site operations within Lebanon

#### 2.1.4 BDL Basic Circular 128/2013 --- Scope of Restriction

-   **Key Restrictions under Circular 128:**
    -   Compliance monitoring cannot be outsourced (Article 11).
        -   **Clarification:** Circular 128 does not, by itself,
            prohibit outsourcing technology, infrastructure, hosting,
            managed security operations, or other IT/operational
            services, provided the institution maintains an in‑house,
            independent Compliance Department and retains overall
            accountability.
    -   BDL must have supervisory access to all systems
    -   Exit strategies must be documented

#### 2.1.5 Banking Secrecy Law of 1956

-   **Critical Requirements:**
    -   Client confidentiality (with significant legal exceptions
        introduced by recent amendments).
    -   **Key Amendments (Law No. 306/2022, and further in 2025)** now
        permit authorized bodies (judiciary, tax authorities, BDL, BCC,
        and appointed auditors) to access banking records to investigate
        corruption, conduct audits, and ensure financial transparency.
    -   Data containing client information cannot leave Lebanese
        territory without a proper legal framework.
    -   Criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure remain.
    -   **Effect:** Despite amendments, the need for local oversight and
        the law's remaining confidentiality obligations still
        effectively prohibit international cloud hosting for sensitive
        financial data.

## 3 Detailed BDL Circular Analysis

Issued on **November 28, 2017**, this circular mandates a comprehensive
cybersecurity framework for banks and financial institutions.
It requires risk analysis, budget allocation for cybersecurity,
two-factor authentication, strong encryption in transit and at rest (In
practice, the circular requires strong encryption in transit and at
rest; many institutions interpret this as TLS 1.2/1.3 and robust at-rest
encryption for sensitive data), continuous network monitoring, and
penetration testing.
It also requires immediate reporting to BDL and the SIC for suspicious
transactions and cyber incidents.

### 3.4 🏢 BDL Basic Circular 128/2013 - Outsourcing Restrictions

#### 3.4.1 **Outsourcing Governance Framework**

Issued on January 12, 2013, Basic Circular 128 (Decision 11323) requires
banks and financial institutions to establish an autonomous, independent
in‑house Compliance Department (**comprising Legal Compliance and
AML/CFT units**).
It also expressly prohibits outsourcing compliance monitoring, in whole
or in part.

#### 3.4.2 **Core Provisions and Expectations**

##### 3.4.2.1 **Non‑Outsourceable (per Circular 128)**

-   **Compliance Monitoring:** May not be outsourced in whole or in part
    (Article 11). The Compliance Department must be in‑house and
    independent (Articles 1--2).
-   **Note on other control functions:** Circular 128 does not prohibit
    outsourcing Risk Management or Internal Audit; any expectations
    arise from other BDL instruments/supervisory practice. Institutions
    must retain independence, accountability, and oversight; external
    tools/co‑sourcing may be used where permitted.
-   **Decision‑Making Authority:** Strategic and operational decisions
    must remain with the licensed institution. External providers may
    support operations and tooling, but the institution retains
    accountability.

##### 3.4.2.2 **Outsourcing Requirements (general good practice; align contracts accordingly)**

-   **Supervisory Access:** Agreements should enable supervisory access
    and information rights for BDL, the Banking Control Commission
    (BCC), and the SIC, as applicable, to review outsourced activities.
-   **Contractual Protections:** Include clear SLAs, performance
    measures, confidentiality and data‑protection clauses,
    liability/indemnity as appropriate, and remedies/penalties for
    non‑performance.
-   **Exit and Continuity:** Maintain documented exit/transition plans
    and business continuity/disaster recovery arrangements.
-   **Notification/Approvals:** Where specific outsourcing notifications
    or approvals are required under other applicable BDL instructions,
    ensure timely compliance.

##### 3.4.2.3 **Vendor Management:**

-   **Due Diligence:** Thorough evaluation of service providers
-   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of vendor performance
-   **Risk Assessment:** Regular assessment of outsourcing risks
-   **Contingency Planning:** Alternative arrangements in case of vendor
    failure

#### 3.4.3 **ISO 27001:2022* Alignment:**

-   A.15.1 Supplier relationships
-   A.15.2 Supplier service delivery management

*References are to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A controls

### 3.5 ⚖️ Banking Secrecy Law of 1956

#### 3.5.1 **Foundation of Lebanese Banking Confidentiality (As Amended)**

Originally enacted on September 3, 1956, this law established the
principle of banking secrecy that was once a cornerstone of Lebanon's
economy.
However, it has undergone significant amendments, notably with Law No.
306/2022 and **further clarifications* in early 2025**, in response to
the economic crisis and to meet international transparency standards
required by bodies like the IMF.
While the law still protects client confidentiality, it is no longer
absolute.

* Practitioners should verify current status and citations in the
Official Gazette; language reflects market practice as of Aug 2025.

#### 3.5.2 **Key Provisions (Post-Amendment):**

##### 3.5.2.1 **Confidentiality & Its Exceptions:**

-   **Strict Secrecy:** Bank employees are bound to secrecy regarding
    client names, assets, and related facts. Unauthorized disclosure is
    subject to criminal penalties.
-   **Expanded Exceptions:** The amendments have created crucial
    exceptions. Secrecy can now be lifted for a range of authorized
    entities, including:
    -   The Judiciary and the Special Investigation Commission (SIC) for
        investigating financial crimes, corruption, and illicit
        enrichment.
    -   The Central Bank (BDL) and the Banking Control Commission (BCC)
        for supervisory and auditing purposes.
    -   The National Authority for Fighting Corruption.
    -   Tax authorities to verify compliance and combat evasion.
    -   Appointed independent auditors.

##### 3.5.2.2 **Data Protection & Technology Implications:**

-   **Data Sovereignty:** The need for Lebanese authorities to have
    access for supervision and investigation reinforces the requirement
    for client data to remain within Lebanese jurisdiction.
-   **Local Hosting:** Consequently, hosting systems with sensitive
    client financial data on international cloud platforms is
    practically unfeasible, as it would impede the legally mandated
    access and oversight of Lebanese regulatory bodies.
-   **Access Controls:** Strict technical and procedural controls are
    required to manage and log access to client data, especially given
    the new legal exceptions.

#### 3.5.3 **ISO 27001:2022* Alignment:**

-   A.5.12 Classification of information
-   A.5.34 Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information
-   A.13.2 Information transfer

*References are to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A controls
