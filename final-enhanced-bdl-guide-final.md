## Executive Summary

This guide provides Lebanese FinTech companies with a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing Banque Du Liban (BDL) regulatory compliance requirements. It includes practical mapping between BDL regulations and international standards (ISO 27001:2022, ISO 27017, PCI DSS, Basel III) to help organizations achieve regulatory compliance while working with hosting providers.

### üö® Key Regulatory Reality

**BDL effectively prohibits cloud-based solutions** for regulated financial activities through strict data sovereignty requirements and the Banking Secrecy Law of 1956. All data must remain within Lebanese jurisdiction.

- **International cloud hosting** (AWS, Azure, GCP) for production data
- **Data export** without explicit client consent and legal framework
- **Outsourcing of compliance monitoring** to third parties
- **Remote access from outside Lebanon** to production systems
- **Data processing outside Lebanese territory**
- **Backup replication** to foreign data centers

#### **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS** ‚úÖ

- **Prior BDL approval** for all digital banking applications
- **24-hour incident reporting** to BDL for security incidents
- **Two-factor authentication** for all system access
- **Board-approved business continuity plans** submitted to BCC
- **Lebanese jurisdiction** for all data and infrastructure
