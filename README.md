## üÜï What's New in v2.1 (December 2024)

### üìú Banking Secrecy Law Amendments
- **Law No. 306/2022 & 2025 Amendments** now permit authorized access for:
  - Judiciary and Special Investigation Commission (SIC)
  - Tax authorities for compliance verification
  - BDL and Banking Control Commission (BCC) for supervision
  - National Authority for Fighting Corruption
  - Appointed independent auditors

### üîç Key Clarifications
- **Cloud Prohibition:** Clarified as practical effect of data sovereignty requirements, not explicit circular
- **RTO/RPO Targets:** Clearly marked as recommendations, not BDL mandates
- **HSM Requirements:** FIPS 140-2 Level 2 acceptable for certain use cases, Level 3 preferred
- **Official References:** Added direct links to BDL circular documents

## üö® Critical Compliance Alert

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:** While BDL has not issued a standalone circular explicitly prohibiting all forms of cloud computing, its stringent data sovereignty requirements, coupled with the Banking Secrecy Law provisions and BDL's supervisory oversight, effectively mandate that all sensitive financial data for regulated activities must remain within Lebanese jurisdiction.

### ‚ùå **Absolute Prohibitions (Practical Effect)**
- International cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, GCP) for production data
- Data export without explicit client consent and legal framework
- Outsourcing of compliance monitoring (Circular 128/2013)
- Remote access from outside Lebanon to production systems
- Data processing outside Lebanese territory
- Backup replication to foreign data centers

### ‚úÖ **Mandatory Requirements**
- Prior BDL approval for all digital banking applications
- 24-hour incident reporting to BDL
- Two-factor authentication for all system access
- Board-approved business continuity plans
- Lebanese jurisdiction for all data
- End-to-end encryption for all transmissions
